# Buildings
Buildings can be constructed in your city to improve your city's functionality. Buildings can improve decrees, wealth, population, and structure. Without upgrading them, they sit as empty spots on your city. To build them, allocate effort to one of the buildings in `city.buildings`. However, buildings also require gold equal to the required effort to upgrade. Once the required amount of effort and gold required to upgrade is reached, the building will be upgraded.

For example, if you wanted to allocate effort to the Instant Decree Booster, you would type `actions.add_effort(city.buildings[BuildingType.police_station], amount)`. For more information on allocating effort, see [Effort](effort.html).

There are 6 types of buildings:
- [Police Station](#police-station)
- [Gelato Shop](#gelato-shop)
- [Mint](#mint)
- [Billboard](#billboard)
- [3D Printer](#3d-printer)
- [Big Canoe](#big-canoe)

## Big Canoe
The big canoe. This beast gives you additional wealth, population, and structure. As with the population and structure boosters, population and structure will not be added past their max. However, structure is added first, so if population and structure are equal, they will increase at equal rates.
