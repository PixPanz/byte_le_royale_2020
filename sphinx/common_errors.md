#####Attribute Error: `<object>` has no attribute '`<attribute>`'This error can occur if you try to call a value or method that does not exist for the given object. Make sure you're spelling the attribute properly, and check the [API](API.html) to make sure that the attribute actually exists.#####Game running at ? turns/s 1585af66-6e4a-4576-9367-66dcc850d5f2 failed to reply in time and has been droppedThis error will occur when your client runs out of time on a given turn to complete its turn. This often occurs when there are too many print statements, any infinite loops, or other time-delaying functions. #####My team\_name/city\_name/city\_type aren't appearing! What do I do?This error is probably caused by the corresponding function not appearing, or the function is being named incorrectly. Make sure the functions 'team\_name', 'city\_name', and 'city\_type' are being named properly and returned the values you want them to return.
